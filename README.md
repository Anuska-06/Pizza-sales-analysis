#  Pizza Sales Analysis â€” SQL Project

Welcome to the **Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project**, where we dive deep into sales data for a fictional pizza restaurant chain to extract meaningful business insights. This project showcases the use of **advanced SQL** to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify performance trends, and uncover opportunities for growth.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset contains transactional data from a pizza sales system, including order details, quantities, prices, and timestamps.

### Key Tables:

- `orders`: Contains order IDs and order dates.
- `order_details`: Line-item level details including quantity and total price.
- `pizzas`: Pizza types with size and price.
- `pizza_types`: Descriptions and categories of pizzas.

##  Project Objectives

- Perform business-focused SQL analysis to answer key operational and marketing questions.
- Identify:
  - Best-selling pizzas
  - Peak sales hours and days
  - Revenue drivers by size, type, and category
  - Monthly sales trends
  - Opportunities for product and inventory optimization

##  Key SQL Insights

> Below are examples of questions explored using SQL:

- What are the **top 5 most sold pizzas** by quantity?
- Which **pizza size** contributes the most to revenue?
- What are the **peak hours** of the day for sales?
- How does **monthly revenue trend** across the year?
- Which **pizza categories** perform the best?

Each of these questions is solved using **CTEs**, **window functions**, **aggregations**, and **date/time functions** in SQL.
